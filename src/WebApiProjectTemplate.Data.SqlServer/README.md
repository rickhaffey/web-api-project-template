# WebApiProjectTemplate Data-SqlServer Project

Contains data-access implementations, as well as your NHibernate mappings. This project is what makes the Data project SQL Server–specific at runtime. As you build up your services application, you should note that no code references any types contained in this project; instead, the code references only the Data project.

(Based on the project structure described and implemented in [ASP.NET Web API 2: Building a REST Service from Start to Finish](http://www.amazon.com/ASP-NET-Web-API-Building-Service/dp/1484201108/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1429269153&sr=8-1&keywords=9781484201107) by Jamie Kurtz and Brian Wortman)
