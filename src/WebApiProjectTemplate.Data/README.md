# WebApiProjectTemplate Data Project

Contains the domain model Plain Old CLR Objects (POCOs); these are used by NHibernate to pull/push data from the database. Also contains the data-access interfaces and helper classes. However, nothing in this project is specific to SQL Server.

(Based on the project structure described and implemented in [ASP.NET Web API 2: Building a REST Service from Start to Finish](http://www.amazon.com/ASP-NET-Web-API-Building-Service/dp/1484201108/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1429269153&sr=8-1&keywords=9781484201107) by Jamie Kurtz and Brian Wortman)
